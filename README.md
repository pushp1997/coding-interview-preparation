# Coding Interview Preparation
This repository contains my submissions and learnings from the Educative's course: [Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in Python](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python) 


## Pattern: Sliding Window

[Worthy Quick Read](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/sliding-window/)

### How to identify?
* The problem involves a data structure that is ordered and iterable like arrays, strings, etc.
* The problem is asking to find a subrange in an array/string, contiguous longest, shortest, average or target value.
* There is an apparent naive or brute force solution that runs in O(N2), O(2N) or some other large time complexity.
* The amazing thing about sliding window problems is that most of the time they can be solved in O(N) time and O(1) space complexity.

## Pattern: Two pointers

[Worthy Quick Read](https://emre.me/coding-patterns/two-pointers/)

### How to identify?
* The problem involve sorted arrays (or Linked Lists), a set of pair elements, or a triplet or even a subarray.
* There is a target value to match or duplicates to be removed.
* Most of these type of problems can be solved in O(N) time complexity and O(1) or O(N) space complexity.

## FAQs
* [How sliding window approach is different from two pointers approach](https://discuss.educative.io/t/how-sliding-window-approach-is-different-from-two-pointers-approach/29325)
